FILTERFS TRANSLATOR

WHAT'S THIS?
filterfs is a GNU/Hurd translator that filters the contents of the directory it 
is set upon according to the result of execution of a given command.

WHAT'S IT FOR?
This translator is intended as a preparatory exercise for the namespace-based 
translator selection project (see http://www.bddebian.com/~wiki/community/gsoc/), 
so it does not really have a stand-alone importance :-)
